## A. Skill Invocation
- This skill is invoked when the user mentions `gsd-new-workspace` or describes a task matching this skill.
- Treat all user text after the skill mention as `{{GSD_ARGS}}`.
- If no arguments are present, treat `{{GSD_ARGS}}` as empty.

## B. User Prompting
When the workflow needs user input, prompt the user conversationally:
- Present options as a numbered list in your response text
- Ask the user to reply with their choice
- For multi-select, ask for comma-separated numbers

## C. Tool Usage
Use these Kiro tools when executing GSD workflows:
- `execute_bash` for running commands (terminal operations)
- `fs_write` with str_replace for editing existing files
- `fs_read`, `fs_write`, `glob`, `grep`, `use_subagent`, `web_search`, `web_fetch`, `todo_list` as needed

## D. Subagent Spawning
When the workflow needs to spawn a subagent, use the `use_subagent` tool:
- Set `agent_name` to the GSD agent (e.g., "gsd-executor", "gsd-planner", "gsd-verifier")
- Set `query` to the full task description including file paths to read
- Set `relevant_context` for additional context
- Up to 4 subagents can run in parallel for independent tasks
- Do NOT include `model` or `isolation` parameters — Kiro handles these automatically

<context>
**Flags:**
- `--name` (required) — Workspace name
- `--repos` — Comma-separated repo paths or names. If omitted, interactive selection from child git repos in cwd
- `--path` — Target directory. Defaults to `~/gsd-workspaces/<name>`
- `--strategy` — `worktree` (default, lightweight) or `clone` (fully independent)
- `--branch` — Branch to checkout. Defaults to `workspace/<name>`
- `--auto` — Skip interactive questions, use defaults
</context>

<objective>
Create a physical workspace directory containing copies of specified git repos (as worktrees or clones) with an independent `.planning/` directory for isolated GSD sessions.

**Use cases:**
- Multi-repo orchestration: work on a subset of repos in parallel with isolated GSD state
- Feature branch isolation: create a worktree of the current repo with its own `.planning/`

**Creates:**
- `<path>/WORKSPACE.md` — workspace manifest
- `<path>/.planning/` — independent planning directory
- `<path>/<repo>/` — git worktree or clone for each specified repo

**After this command:** `cd` into the workspace and run `/gsd-new-project` to initialize GSD.

Execute the new-workspace workflow from @$HOME/.kiro/get-shit-done/workflows/new-workspace.md end-to-end.
Preserve all workflow gates (validation, approvals, commits, routing).
