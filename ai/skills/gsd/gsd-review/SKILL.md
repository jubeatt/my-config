## A. Skill Invocation
- This skill is invoked when the user mentions `gsd-review` or describes a task matching this skill.
- Treat all user text after the skill mention as `{{GSD_ARGS}}`.
- If no arguments are present, treat `{{GSD_ARGS}}` as empty.

## B. User Prompting
When the workflow needs user input, prompt the user conversationally:
- Present options as a numbered list in your response text
- Ask the user to reply with their choice
- For multi-select, ask for comma-separated numbers

## C. Tool Usage
Use these Kiro tools when executing GSD workflows:
- `execute_bash` for running commands (terminal operations)
- `fs_write` with str_replace for editing existing files
- `fs_read`, `fs_write`, `glob`, `grep`, `use_subagent`, `web_search`, `web_fetch`, `todo_list` as needed

## D. Subagent Spawning
When the workflow needs to spawn a subagent, use the `use_subagent` tool:
- Set `agent_name` to the GSD agent (e.g., "gsd-executor", "gsd-planner", "gsd-verifier")
- Set `query` to the full task description including file paths to read
- Set `relevant_context` for additional context
- Up to 4 subagents can run in parallel for independent tasks
- Do NOT include `model` or `isolation` parameters — Kiro handles these automatically

<objective>
Invoke external AI CLIs (Gemini, Claude, Codex, Kiro) to independently review phase plans.
Produces a structured REVIEWS.md with per-reviewer feedback that can be fed back into
planning via /gsd-plan-phase --reviews.

**Flow:** Detect CLIs → Build review prompt → Invoke each CLI → Collect responses → Write REVIEWS.md
</objective>

<execution_context>
@$HOME/.kiro/get-shit-done/workflows/review.md
</execution_context>

<context>
Phase number: extracted from {{GSD_ARGS}} (required)

**Flags:**
- `--gemini` — Include Gemini CLI review
- `--claude` — Include Claude CLI review (uses separate session)
- `--codex` — Include Codex CLI review
- `--kiro` — Include Kiro CLI review
- `--all` — Include all available CLIs
</context>

<process>
Execute the review workflow from @$HOME/.kiro/get-shit-done/workflows/review.md end-to-end.
</process>
