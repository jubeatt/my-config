## A. Skill Invocation
- This skill is invoked when the user mentions `gsd-map-codebase` or describes a task matching this skill.
- Treat all user text after the skill mention as `{{GSD_ARGS}}`.
- If no arguments are present, treat `{{GSD_ARGS}}` as empty.

## B. User Prompting
When the workflow needs user input, prompt the user conversationally:
- Present options as a numbered list in your response text
- Ask the user to reply with their choice
- For multi-select, ask for comma-separated numbers

## C. Tool Usage
Use these Kiro tools when executing GSD workflows:
- `execute_bash` for running commands (terminal operations)
- `fs_write` with str_replace for editing existing files
- `fs_read`, `fs_write`, `glob`, `grep`, `use_subagent`, `web_search`, `web_fetch`, `todo_list` as needed

## D. Subagent Spawning
When the workflow needs to spawn a subagent, use the `use_subagent` tool:
- Set `agent_name` to the GSD agent (e.g., "gsd-executor", "gsd-planner", "gsd-verifier")
- Set `query` to the full task description including file paths to read
- Set `relevant_context` for additional context
- Up to 4 subagents can run in parallel for independent tasks
- Do NOT include `model` or `isolation` parameters — Kiro handles these automatically

<objective>
Analyze existing codebase using parallel gsd-codebase-mapper agents to produce structured codebase documents.

Each mapper agent explores a focus area and **writes documents directly** to `.planning/codebase/`. The orchestrator only receives confirmations, keeping context usage minimal.

Output: .planning/codebase/ folder with 7 structured documents about the codebase state.
</objective>

<execution_context>
@$HOME/.kiro/get-shit-done/workflows/map-codebase.md
</execution_context>

<context>
Focus area: {{GSD_ARGS}} (optional - if provided, tells agents to focus on specific subsystem)

**Load project state if exists:**
Check for .planning/STATE.md - loads context if project already initialized

**This command can run:**
- Before /gsd-new-project (brownfield codebases) - creates codebase map first
- After /gsd-new-project (greenfield codebases) - updates codebase map as code evolves
- Anytime to refresh codebase understanding
</context>

<when_to_use>
**Use map-codebase for:**
- Brownfield projects before initialization (understand existing code first)
- Refreshing codebase map after significant changes
- Onboarding to an unfamiliar codebase
- Before major refactoring (understand current state)
- When STATE.md references outdated codebase info

**Skip map-codebase for:**
- Greenfield projects with no code yet (nothing to map)
- Trivial codebases (<5 files)
</when_to_use>

<process>
1. Check if .planning/codebase/ already exists (offer to refresh or skip)
2. Create .planning/codebase/ directory structure
3. Spawn 4 parallel gsd-codebase-mapper agents:
   - Agent 1: tech focus → writes STACK.md, INTEGRATIONS.md
   - Agent 2: arch focus → writes ARCHITECTURE.md, STRUCTURE.md
   - Agent 3: quality focus → writes CONVENTIONS.md, TESTING.md
   - Agent 4: concerns focus → writes CONCERNS.md
4. Wait for agents to complete, collect confirmations (NOT document contents)
5. Verify all 7 documents exist with line counts
6. Commit codebase map
7. Offer next steps (typically: /gsd-new-project or /gsd-plan-phase)
</process>

<success_criteria>
- [ ] .planning/codebase/ directory created
- [ ] All 7 codebase documents written by mapper agents
- [ ] Documents follow template structure
- [ ] Parallel agents completed without errors
- [ ] User knows next steps
</success_criteria>
