## A. Skill Invocation
- This skill is invoked when the user mentions `gsd-pr-branch` or describes a task matching this skill.
- Treat all user text after the skill mention as `{{GSD_ARGS}}`.
- If no arguments are present, treat `{{GSD_ARGS}}` as empty.

## B. User Prompting
When the workflow needs user input, prompt the user conversationally:
- Present options as a numbered list in your response text
- Ask the user to reply with their choice
- For multi-select, ask for comma-separated numbers

## C. Tool Usage
Use these Kiro tools when executing GSD workflows:
- `execute_bash` for running commands (terminal operations)
- `fs_write` with str_replace for editing existing files
- `fs_read`, `fs_write`, `glob`, `grep`, `use_subagent`, `web_search`, `web_fetch`, `todo_list` as needed

## D. Subagent Spawning
When the workflow needs to spawn a subagent, use the `use_subagent` tool:
- Set `agent_name` to the GSD agent (e.g., "gsd-executor", "gsd-planner", "gsd-verifier")
- Set `query` to the full task description including file paths to read
- Set `relevant_context` for additional context
- Up to 4 subagents can run in parallel for independent tasks
- Do NOT include `model` or `isolation` parameters — Kiro handles these automatically

<objective>
Create a clean branch suitable for pull requests by filtering out .planning/ commits
from the current branch. Reviewers see only code changes, not GSD planning artifacts.

This solves the problem of PR diffs being cluttered with PLAN.md, SUMMARY.md, STATE.md
changes that are irrelevant to code review.
